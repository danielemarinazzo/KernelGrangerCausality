You will find among others the scripts: 

`test_KGC_KCL` run kernel causality on a simulated network of 5 nodes

`test_biv_2n`: test KGC on two coupled maps

`test_var_eps_1`: modulation in time of the coupling parameter for the two coupled maps (contains calls to Granger causality and correlation with sliding window)

`run_crossvalidation`: estimate the model order using leave-one-out crossvalidation
